  "description": "This is a single-player memory matching game where the player must match pairs of cards with the same value. The game starts with a grid of face-down cards, each with a hidden value. On each turn, the player flips over two cards to reveal their hidden values. If the values match, the cards remain face-up and the player earns a point. If the values do not match, the cards are flipped back over and the player loses a point. The game continues until all pairs have been matched.",
